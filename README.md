EOG Signal Feature Extraction and Eye Movement Classification


Statistical and morphological features are extracted from EOG signals through analysis, and classification models based on Random Forest and CNN are constructed for extracting eye movements from EOG signals. Following the creation of these models, research is ongoing on associating eye movements with body movements. Efforts are being made to integrate real-time signal processing and classification algorithms.
